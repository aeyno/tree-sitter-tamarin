Feel free to open a pull request with your improvements.

The versionning of this repo will follow the Tamarin versioning, eg. version 1.6.1 of this grammar correspond to the Tamarin prover's grammar in version 1.6.1.
The *develop* branch of this repo will try to follow the [*develop* branch of Tamarin](https://github.com/tamarin-prover/tamarin-prover/tree/develop) as closely as possible but there may be some delay between the implementation in Tamarin and this grammar.
